'
' This version of the serial port driver was rewritten entirely from scratch in early
' 2015 with three goals, in order: Correctness, Performance, Code Size. While it is
' an entirely new implementation, it draws heavily on the design and implementation of
' many original and derived works that preceed it. 
'
' Tx and Rx pins are user defined and each port may use neither, either or both. The
' Baud rate is identical for Tx and Rx of a given port. Baud rates up to 460800K have
' been characterized and tested.

' To use the object:
'       1) Call Initialize
'       2) Call Define_Port for each port that will be used
'       3) Call Start
'       4) Make calls to any of the various input and output routines.
'       5) Call Stop.
'       6) Repeat as desired.
'
' Notes:
'       1) Associating the same pin with both Tx and Rx channels has undefined results
'       2) Rx and Tx buffers must not overlap and must be at least two bytes in size;
'          other than the limits of available memory there is no upper bound on their sizes 
'       3) Framing and overrun errors are not detected. Overruns of the receive buffer 
'          simply over write previously received data
'       4) Put operations, with the exception of Can_Put are blocking. They will not 
'          return until their data has been buffered for output. Put_Bytes buffers data
'          to the greatest extent possible and may be called with a Count that is greater
'          than the buffer size.
'       5) Flush_Output blocks until the last byte has been extracted from the buffer; but
'          that byte has not yet been transmitted at the time Flush returns
'       6) Get is a blocking operation; it will not return until the associated buffer has data.
'       7) Get_Bytes_Timed will not return until all requested data has arrived or the timer
'          has expired. It will not return partial data. Calling this routine with a Count
'          that is greater than the size of the receive buffer will never return any data

'
' Data structures:
'
' The data structures used are not for the faint of heart. Worse yet, the Propeller
' architecture makes shared data structures both complicated to code and difficult
' to understand.
'
' The fundamental buffer structures are ring buffers designed for a single producer
' and a single consumer. They are inherently thread safe without the use of any kind
' of locking between producer and consumer. However, they are not tolerant of multiple
' producers or multiple consumers and any use requiring such must be serialized
' externally.
'
' The buffer storage is provided by the caller of Initialize. The buffers may be of any
' length greater than two bytes and as large as all available memory.
'
' Each channel (receive and transmit) has four variables used to control access. These are the
' Buffer Base Address, the Buffer Size (in bytes), the Insertion Index and the Extraction Index.
'
' Throughout, these things are called:
'   TxB   - Transmit Buffer Base
'   TxS   - Tranmsit Buffer Size
'   Tx_II - Transmit Buffer Insertion Index
'   Tx_EI - Tranmsit Buffer Extraction Index
'   RxB   - Receive Buffer Base
'   RxS   - Receive Buffer Size
'   Rx_II - Receive Buffer Insertion Index
'   Rx_EI - Receive Buffer Extraction Index
'
' If a channel is not in use, make sure its Pin No_Pin. There is no special code anywhere
' to make this work, it's simply a by product of the implementation.
'
' Insertion and Extraction indices are zero based and always in the range 0 .. Size - 1
'
' The Insertion Index is the index of the last inserted byte
' The Extraction Index is the index of the next byte available
' The Buffer is empty if the Insertion Index is equal to the Extraction Index
'
' The aforementioned buffer control variables are shared between the Spin and the Assembly
' language portions of the driver. The buffer base and buffer sizes are static and, thus,
' shared by copy. However, the Insertion and Extraction indicies are dynamic and must be
' shared by reference. Variables ending in _Ref and the pointers to the associated indicies
' so, for example, Tx_II_Ref must point to Tx_II. These reference are static and are shared
' by copy.

'
' The quad port driver
'
' The driver is organized as eight ligthweight threads that are cooperatively
' scheduled using the jmpret instruction. A jmpret R, S stores its PC + 1 at R
' and loads the PC from S. By organizing the threads in a circular fashion,
' we get Rx0 -> Tx0 -> Rx1 -> Tx1 ... Tx3 -> Rx0.
'
' Theoretical Performance
'
' By keeping the number of instructions between jmpret small, we increase the bit
' rate at which any given channel can operate. By keeping the number of instructions
' between jmpret identical, we reduce jitter.
'
' Receive Latency:
'       Awaiting start bit:     12 
'       Shifting in a byte:     32 
'       Shifting last bit:      36    <- Worst case while receiving 
'       Buffering a byte:       36-51 <- Worst case is 51 clocks 
'       Awaiting stop bit:      12 
'       After stop seen:        24 
'
' Transmit Latency:
'       Awaiting data:          20-35
'       Found data:             28-43
'       Extract buffered byte:  28-43
'       Maintain pointers:      36-51 <- Worst case is 51 clocks
'       Transmit first bit:     32
'       Check bit time:         20
'       Transmit other bits:    36    <- Worst case while transmitting
'       Transmit last bit:      32
'
' The worst case receive latency is a combination of the worst case receiver
' latency while receiving plus the worst case for all other channels regardless
' of what they're doing. Worst case transmit latency is computed using the same
' approach. It's a bit of work and a bit of coincidence that the paths are highly
' symmetric.

' Note - Order Matters!
'
' The following declarations are grouped in quads, one for each port.
' This partial ordering must be maintained because the Spin code makes
' array references, indexing by Port. There are no dependencies among
' the various quads and they may be reordered at will provided those
' that get block cleared remain between the labels that designate that
' region. 
'
' The Insertion and Extraction Indices are handled differently for
' Transmit and Receive.
'
' For the transmitter, there is a local extraction index and an external
' insertion and extraction index. The external insertion index is always
' accessed throught the reference. The external extraction index is updated
' by reference whenever the internal extraction index is modified.
'
' For the receiver, there is local and an external insertion index. The
' external insertion index is updated whenever the local index is modified.
' The receiver neither knows nor cares about the extraction index and will
' overrun the buffer if the client does not keep up.
'
' The Index References are initialized explicitly because the dumb 
' compiler doesn't have any sort of relocation fixup!
