//
// This version of the serial port driver was rewritten entirely from scratch in early
// 2015 with three goals, in order: Correctness, Performance, Code Size. While it is
// an entirely new implementation, it draws heavily on the design and implementation of
// many original and derived works that preceed it. 
//
// Tx and Rx pins are user defined and each port may use neither, either or both. The
// Baud rate is identical for Tx and Rx of a given port. Baud rates up to 460800K have
// been characterized and tested.
//
// To use the object:
//       1) Call Initialize
//       2) Call Define_Port for each port that will be used
//       3) Call Start
//       4) Make calls to any of the various input and output routines.
//       5) Call Stop.
//       6) Repeat as desired.
//
// Notes:
//       1) Associating the same pin with both Tx and Rx channels has undefined results
//       2) Rx and Tx buffers must not overlap and must be at least two bytes in size;
//          other than the limits of available memory there is no upper bound on their sizes 
//       3) Framing and overrun errors are not detected. Overruns of the receive buffer 
//          simply over write previously received data
//       4) Put operations, with the exception of Can_Put are blocking. They will not 
//          return until their data has been buffered for output. Put_Bytes buffers data
//          to the greatest extent possible and may be called with a Count that is greater
//          than the buffer size.
//       5) Flush_Output blocks until the last byte has been extracted from the buffer; but
//          that byte has not yet been transmitted at the time Flush returns
//       6) Get is a blocking operation; it will not return until the associated buffer has data.
//       7) Get_Bytes_Timed will not return until all requested data has arrived or the timer
//          has expired. It will not return partial data. Calling this routine with a Count
//          that is greater than the size of the receive buffer will never return any data
//
// Revision History
// 150220        Substantial rewrite including the following changes
//                 Improved calculation of TPB and SO
//                 Changed Can_Put to take a byte count
//                 Deleted Try_Put
//                 Modified Get_Timed to use Get_Bytes_Timed
//                 Modified Put_ZString to call Put_Bytes
//                 Modified Put_Bytes to use bytemove
//                 Modified Get_Bytes_Timed to use bytemove
//                 Reduced latency receiver
//                 Stopped shifting in stop bit
//                 Reduced latency of transmitter

//
// Data structures:
//
// The data structures used are not for the faint of heart. Worse yet, the Propeller
// architecture makes shared data structures both complicated to code and difficult
// to understand.
//
// The fundamental buffer structures are ring buffers designed for a single producer
// and a single consumer. They are inherently thread safe without the use of any kind
// of locking between producer and consumer. However, they are not tolerant of multiple
// producers or multiple consumers and any use requiring such must be serialized
// externally.
//
// The buffer storage is provided by the caller of Initialize. The buffers may be of any
// length greater than two bytes and as large as all available memory.
//
// Each channel (receive and transmit) has four variables used to control access. These are the
// Buffer Base Address, the Buffer Size (in bytes), the Insertion Index and the Extraction Index.
//
// Throughout, these things are called:
//   TxB   - Transmit Buffer Base
//   TxS   - Tranmsit Buffer Size
//   Tx_II - Transmit Buffer Insertion Index
//   Tx_EI - Tranmsit Buffer Extraction Index
//   RxB   - Receive Buffer Base
//   RxS   - Receive Buffer Size
//   Rx_II - Receive Buffer Insertion Index
//   Rx_EI - Receive Buffer Extraction Index
//
// If a channel is not in use, make sure its Pin No_Pin. There is no special code anywhere
// to make this work, it's simply a by product of the implementation.
//
// Insertion and Extraction indices are zero based and always in the range 0 .. Size - 1
//
// The Insertion Index is the index of the last inserted byte
// The Extraction Index is the index of the next byte available
// The Buffer is empty if the Insertion Index is equal to the Extraction Index
//
// The aforementioned buffer control variables are shared between the Spin and the Assembly
// language portions of the driver. The buffer base and buffer sizes are static and, thus,
// shared by copy. However, the Insertion and Extraction indicies are dynamic and must be
// shared by reference. Variables ending in _Ref and the pointers to the associated indicies
// so, for example, Tx_II_Ref must point to Tx_II. These reference are static and are shared
// by copy.
